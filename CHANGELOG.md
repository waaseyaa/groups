# Changelog — waaseyaa/groups

## Unreleased

- **Documentation:** `composer.json` description is Packagist-facing and no longer references a specific application. README emphasizes app-agnostic scope; extraction history is noted here instead.

### Deprecated

- **`Waaseyaa\Entity\Community\HasCommunityInterface` and `HasCommunityTrait`.** Tenancy opt-in is moving from a class-hierarchy marker to a declarative key on `EntityType` registration. Consumers must declare `tenancy: ['scope' => 'community']` on the entity type. The marker interface continues to function during this release; `LoggerInterface::warning()` emits a one-time deprecation notice per `(entity-type id, process)` on first wiring. Removal scheduled for the next minor release. See migration recipe below. (Mission #1257 WP10 / contract C1.)

### Migrating from `HasCommunityInterface` to declarative `tenancy:`

This release moves community-scoping opt-in from a marker interface on the entity class to a declarative key on `EntityType` registration. The change unblocks framework-shipped `final` entity classes (e.g. `Waaseyaa\Groups\Group`) from being community-scoped by consumers — historically blocked because a `final` class cannot be marked from outside.

#### What changes

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `class MyEntity extends ContentEntityBase implements HasCommunityInterface { use HasCommunityTrait; }` | `class MyEntity extends ContentEntityBase { /* no marker */ }` |
| Service-provider wiring: `is_a($entityType->getClass(), HasCommunityInterface::class, true)` triggers `CommunityScope` injection | `EntityType` registration declares `tenancy: ['scope' => 'community']`; `SqlStorageDriver` and `MemoryStorageDriver` wire `CommunityScope` from this declaration. |
| Schema requires the entity table to carry a `community_id` column. | Unchanged — the schema column stays. The trait no longer drives wiring; column ownership is independent. |

#### Migration steps

1. **Add `tenancy:` to your `EntityType` registration.**

   ```php
   $entityTypeManager->registerEntityType(new EntityType(
       id: 'my_entity',
       label: 'My Entity',
       class: MyEntity::class,
       keys: ['id' => 'id', 'uuid' => 'uuid', 'label' => 'name'],
       tenancy: ['scope' => 'community'],   // ← NEW
   ));
   ```

2. **Verify isolation tests still pass.** Run your existing cross-tenant isolation suite. Behavior should be identical — `CommunityScope` is still injected, just from a different signal.

3. **Remove `HasCommunityInterface` from the class.** Delete the `implements HasCommunityInterface` clause and the `use HasCommunityTrait;` line. The schema column (`community_id`) stays — `ContentEntityBase::get('community_id')` / `set('community_id')` continue to work without the trait.

4. **Confirm the deprecation log line stops firing.** After the registration update, the `[deprecated] HasCommunityInterface on entity-type "X"` warning should no longer appear in your logs on first wiring.

#### Note for adopters mid-migration on `Waaseyaa\Groups\Group`

If your application currently runs a local `App\Entity\Group` alongside a composer dep on `waaseyaa/groups` (a transition state — the local class predates `Waaseyaa\Groups\Group` becoming framework-shipped), apply the migration in this order:

1. **First:** add `tenancy: ['scope' => 'community']` to your `EntityType` registration that uses `Waaseyaa\Groups\Group`.
2. **Then:** verify the cross-tenant isolation tests still pass against the framework class.
3. **Only then:** collapse `App\Entity\Group` onto `Waaseyaa\Groups\Group` (`final`, no `HasCommunityInterface`) and update call sites.

Order matters: the `tenancy:` flip is wiring-local and reversible; the class collapse touches every consumer.

#### Removal timeline

- **This release** (mission #1257 WP10): `tenancy:` ratified canonical; `HasCommunityInterface` continues to function with one-time deprecation log per `(entity-type id, process)`.
- **Next minor release**: `HasCommunityInterface`, `HasCommunityTrait`, and the `is_a()` opt-in check in service providers are removed. Code that still relies on the marker stops getting `CommunityScope` injection at boot — entities will no longer be tenant-scoped without the registration key.
